Programming a computer means working with the structural precision required by
computers. Computers consume data, apply instructions to transform
that data, and produce results in some form that we can use.

We need to develop an agreement between ourselves. We are acting like computers in a network network so we are inserting ourselves into the communication of the machines.. Only by coming up with an agreement can we reliably get our messages across

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is where we talk about how the protocol is separate from the
technology. The big idea is the separation. A black box reduces the
complexity of the system. It also also parts of the system to be
swaped out because the pieces are encapsulated. Technologies can
change underneath the protocol. Each layer of the protocol is separate
from each other.

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.

<p>
Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.

<h3 id="orge4add64">Equations</h3>
<p>
Computer science can help us use precision in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
What is an equation?
</p>

<p>
Have you ever refered to an equation as
containing the answer?

<h3 id="org36b72b2">Functions</h3>
<p>
Repeatable computational abstractions
The target of elementary and middle school mathematics is modeling and
reasoning and expressions and equations standards are functions.
</p>

<p>
Equations are a catch all phrase in mathematics education that often
includes what we mean by functions in algebra.
</p>

<p>
Notice what changes, collect and plot data, predict/interpolate values

<h3 id="org707dbab">Imagine data entities</h3>
<p>
Data entities are elements of our world that we might want to track as data.
</p>

<p>
Students in a school are often represented as a data point with a
number of dimensions. Some of the dimensions (or attributes)
associated with a student are attendance, credits, biographicals.
</p>

<p>
<b>Brainstorm</b> data entities from your own life.
