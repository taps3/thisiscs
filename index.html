Notice means what do you see. Call out the obvious. Make simple observations. Go for quantity.

Wonder means begin an idea and consider possibilities. Wonderings are questions with their possible answers.

Programming a computer means working with the structural precision required by
computers. Computers consume data, apply instructions to transform

Code is a great book if you've ever wondered how do computers work. It starts with a simple story about 2 children communicating with flashlight to cross the street And ends building a simple computer A piece is that you can think about yourself
</p>

<p>
Send to tetris take the step further and delivers an entire curriculum where you write code you write code to bill's computer parts that you then assemble andAnd that can be spoken to in a language

We need to develop an agreement between ourselves. We are acting like computers in a network network so we are inserting ourselves into the communication of the machines.. Only by coming up with an agreement can we reliably get our messages across

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is where we talk about how the protocol is separate from the
technology. The big idea is the separation. A black box reduces the
complexity of the system. It also also parts of the system to be
swaped out because the pieces are encapsulated. Technologies can
change underneath the protocol. Each layer of the protocol is separate
from each other.

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.
</p>

<p>
Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.

The Problems with Elon Musk's Plan to Open-Source the Twitter Algorithm
MIT Technology Review
Chris Stokel-Walker
April 27, 2022
</p>

<p>
Elon Musk’s announced plans for the Twitter social network include open-sourcing its algorithms, which experts say would do little to boost transparency without access to their training data. Said Jennifer Cobbe of the U.K.'s University of Cambridge, "Most of the time when people talk about algorithmic accountability these days, we recognize that the algorithms themselves aren't necessarily what we want to see—what we really want is information about how they were developed." There also are concerns open-sourcing Twitter's algorithms would enable bad actors to identify vulnerabilities to exploit and could make it more difficult to defeat spam bots.

Method Makes Traffic Prediction Faster
Futurity.org
Matt Shipman
May 5, 2022
</p>

<p>
North Carolina State University (NC State) researchers modified an algorithm developed to help simplify complex computing tasks to better anticipate traffic patterns in a specific place and time. The algorithm segments a bigger traffic forecasting model into a series of smaller problems that can be solved simultaneously. The process shortens the forecasting model's run time, while more complex questions tend to lead to higher levels of improved efficiency. The tweaked algorithm also enhances run time by allowing the model to realize when it has reached a solution that is within 5%, or even 10%, of the optimal solution. NC State's Ali Hajbabaie said the modified algorithm uses much less computer memory, and runs orders of magnitude faster, than a benchmark algorithm.

Open-Source 'Package Analysis' Tool Finds Malicious npm, PyPI Packages
BleepingComputer
Ax Sharma
May 1, 2022
</p>

<p>
The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)'s prototype Package Analysis tool caught more than 200 malicious npm and Python Package Index (PyPI) packages in its initial run. Released this week on software development platform GitHub, the tool is designed to identify and counter malware in open source registries. OpenSSF's Caleb Brown and David A. Wheeler said the tool was developed to help users "understand the behavior and capabilities of packages available on open-source repositories: what files do they access, what addresses do they connect to, and what commands do they run? The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously." Most of the malicious elements the tool identified in its initial run were dependency confusion and typosquatting exploits.

Algorithm That Screens for Child Neglect Raises Concerns
Associated Press
Sally Ho; Garance Burke
April 29, 2022
</p>

<p>
A review of an algorithm designed to screen for child neglect has raised worrying issues, including questions of reliability. Carnegie Mellon University researchers analyzed a tool used by Allegheny County, PA, which in its first years of use identified a disproportionate number of Black children for "mandatory neglect" probes compared to white children; social workers also disagreed with the algorithm's risk scores about one-third of the time. Critics say the algorithm gives data on poor people excessive influence in deciding families' fates, and they caution against local officials' increasing reliance on artificial intelligence. Advocates fear that if similar tools are adopted by other child welfare systems with little to no human intervention, they could compound racial disparities.

<li>Pivot tables are summaries of large tables</li>
<li>By grouping data together we can make a new table where each row entity is a summary of some part

<ul>
<li>An expression is when you apply a function to a value. The function does its job and gives back the result.</li>
<li>Expressions are like a sentence with verbs and nouns.
<ul>
<li>Verbs in a expression are called <b>Functions</b></li>
<li>Nouns in a expression are called <b>Values</b></li>

<h3 id="org0a9e5ee">Function Contracts (protocols)</h3>
<p>
A contract is an agreement with the function. If we follow the contract, the function will do work for us. We need to give the function what is expected in its contract in order for it to do its work.
Type <code>=concatenate</code>
Click <code>?</code> to see the function contract

can copy down the formula by&#x2026;

<li>CTRL+↓ or CTRL+↑ jumps to the top or bottom of a column</li>

Creating custom arrays
You can also create your own arrays in a formula in your spreadsheet by using brackets { }. The brackets allow you to group values, which can be a single number, string or boolean, or a rangeof values.

<h3 id="org05b82bf">Horizontal and Vertical Stacking</h3>
<p>
Use the following punctuation to arrange values in an array:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Commas:</b> Separate columns with a comma to arrange data horizontally. For example, ={1, 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell to the right in a new column.</li>
<li><b>Semicolons:</b> Separate rows with a semicolon to arrange data vertically. For example, ={1; 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell below in a new row.</li>

</ul>

Try on your own.
