Round Robin algorithm

* Notice & Wonder

Lots of notice

Wonder means begin an idea, consider possibilities

Wonderings are questions with possible answers


#+BEGIN_NOTES
Just forming a answer that might be right is a big win. What kind of
answer would even make sense here? What units? What range of values?
What constraints? What motivations?

* Let's talk about computers
** Computers

   :CREATED:  [2022-04-28 Thu 19:19]
   :END:

consume data (which includes instructions), transform it using instructions (which can be sealed out for new instructions), and return some useful result. 

#+REVEAL: split:t

From person to machine
Navigation, star charting, understanding the cosmos
All data analysis with huge computations
Aids like the abacus add mechanical memory to the computation process

** Switches

Flashlights, Telegraph, Boolean Algebra

On/Off languages, binary languages, binary algebra

Electronic and photonic switches are fast.

Translate computational problems into binary problems and give it to
the machine

** Structure

Programming a computer means working with the structural precision required by
computers. Computers consume data, apply instructions to transform
that data, and produce results in some form that we can use.

** Computing in the news

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
 I've collected 4 stories that We're in print this week and and represent examples of computing in the wild. We'll read each headline they will set up breakout rooms for each of the different articles you'll choose an article to read and then visit that break out room. The goal is to find the computer in the article

#+BEGIN_NOTES 
 Code is a great book if you've ever wondered how do computers work. It starts with a simple story about 2 children communicating with flashlight to cross the street And ends building a simple computer A piece is that you can think about yourself

Send to tetris take the step further and delivers an entire curriculum where you write code you write code to bill's computer parts that you then assemble andAnd that can be spoken to in a language

The mouse organization provides support and curriculum for technology clubs

ACM Tech News is a great resource for students finding are for goals that are actually about computing computing. It is updated updated every other day and well archived

How to play

#+BEGIN_NOTES
 Just like the traditional game where you shake up some letters and write down as many words as you can in one minute You are going to make a list of all the ways that you connected to the Internet  In the past week.  Then compare your notes to the others to the others on your team you get one point for for any use of the Internet that another team member did not have . And may the most connected person win .. And don't forget to use the time chair share a little with each other have a good chat  
#+END_NOTES

** Code.org internet simulator
*** Internet Simulator Overview

#+BEGIN_NOTES
 In the Internet simulator activities we will present a problem And demonstrate setting it up but not solve it together We'll enter breakout rooms to continue working on the problem connecting to the people in our room through the simulator. We need to develop an agreement between ourselves. We are acting like computers in a network network so we are inserting ourselves into the communication of the machines.. Only by coming up with an agreement can we reliably get our messages across
#+END_NOTES

*** Activity Explore the Simulator

- Simulator :: [[https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2021/lessons/1/levels/1?section_id=4067479][First Simulator]]
- Context :: Whole group
- Setup :: Connect to your partner via our first simulator
- Groups :: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S6g80qzFP6Kh0nqy8_QEfPO60P5rcDLoc_Z2H-WoZUc/edit#heading=h.9is4g32neq61][anchor doc groups heading]]
#+REVEAL: split:t

**** Instructions

Two group members connect to each other in the simulator

One of those connected members should share their screen

The additional group member assumes Reporter/Time keeper/Facilitator
while the connected members discuss what they notice about the
simulator.

*** Activity Send/Receive a Bit

Develop a protocol that allows one bit to be sent back and forth using a metronome

*** Activity Send/Receive a Word
*** Activity Send/Receive/Confirm a Word
** Protocols and Abstraction Layers

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is where we talk about how the protocol is separate from the
technology. The big idea is the separation. A black box reduces the
complexity of the system. It also also parts of the system to be
swaped out because the pieces are encapsulated. Technologies can
change underneath the protocol. Each layer of the protocol is separate
from each other.

*** Do one job
** Packets and redundancy

So how do messages get from one place to another

*** Jumps
*** Redundancy
*** Undersea cables
*** Security
*** Passwords
** Connections
** Resources

Tubes: Journey to the center of the internet (teacher knowledge base)

* Let's talk about web creation and portfolio sites
** Choosing tools
** Motivating Web Creation
** Markup languages

- A lighter introduction to structured text
- HTML is a markup language
- Markup means using structure to tell a computer what things mean
- 
- HTML isn't the only option
- HTML 

** Symbols

#+BEGIN_NOTES
How do we tell
the computer which words are the content and which words are
instructions?
#+END_NOTES

** HTML Tags

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Compare indenting in a word process -- hit tab, see the word move --
to writing the word tab at the beginning of the line.  Instructions are given special characters that computers
can recognize. In HTML the symbols are called tags and use the "<" and
">" symbols.
#+END_NOTES

* Let's talk about email
** Locations: labels, tags, folders

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.

Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.

** Archive, Star, Delete

- Archive :: remove the inbox label
- Star :: add a star
- Label :: like star but with a custom name
- Delete :: remove all labels and add a "Trash" label

** Analyze

What kind of messages are you receiving?

Students were getting ten messages per day alerting them to various
activity on the platforms we set up for them: digital classroom,
communication blasts, attendance

** Process

Inbox -> Starred -> Archive
g i s e

Inbox -> Trash
#

Inbox -> Reply
r

** Stars and flags

- Starred is the activity section
- Multiple stars can represent different kinds of action
- 

** Filters

Inbox is a filter. A filter catches some values and let's others
through. Inbox shows us messages that contain the metadata "Inbox". 

Starred or flagged is a filter for all messages containing a metadata
star or flag. 

** Rules
** Notifications

** Work products: analog and digital
** Assessment:  cultivating success
* Part 2 :noexport_reveal:
* Computing in the news
** Resources

* Let's talk about algebra
** Equations

Computer science can help us use precision in mathematics.

What is an equation?

Have you ever refered to an equation as
containing the answer?

** Functions

Repeatable computational abstractions
The target of elementary and middle school mathematics is modeling and
reasoning and expressions and equations standards are functions.

Equations are a catch all phrase in mathematics education that often
includes what we mean by functions in algebra.

Notice what changes, collect and plot data, predict/interpolate values

** Examples

A right circular cone has a height of 11 centimeters and a diameter of
7 centimeters. What is the approximate volume, in cubic centimeters,
of the cone?

- What skill is being assessed?
- What is given (context)?
- 

** Imagine data entities

Data entities are elements of our world that we might want to track as data.

Students in a school are often represented as a data point with a
number of dimensions. Some of the dimensions (or attributes)
associated with a student are attendance, credits, biographicals.

*Brainstorm* data entities from your own life.

* Let's talk about spreadsheets
* Let's talk about data science
* Let's talk about filters and sorts
