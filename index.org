An artificial intelligence (AI) software solution developed by Intel and Classroom Technologies to identify students' emotional states is generating controversy in the context of ethics and privacy.

** Connections
* Let's talk about the internet
** Code.org internet simulator

#+BEGIN_NOTES
What needs to go in the presentation? A presentation about the
internet simulator. What do we need to know?
#+END_NOTES

*** Internet Simulator Overview
*** Activity Send/Receive a Bit
*** Activity Send/Receive a Word
*** Activity Send/Receive/Confirm a Word
** Protocols and Abstraction Layers

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is where we talk about how the protocol is separate from the
technology. The big idea is the separation. A black box reduces the
complexity of the system. It also also parts of the system to be
swaped out because the pieces are encapsulated. Technologies can
change underneath the protocol. Each layer of the protocol is separate
from each other.

*** Do one job
** Packets and redundancy

So how do messages get from one place to another

*** Jumps
*** Redundancy
*** Undersea cables
*** Security
*** Passwords
** Connections
** Resources

Tubes: Journey to the center of the internet (teacher knowledge base)

* Let's talk about computers
** Computers

From person to machine
Navigation, star charting, understanding the cosmos
All data analysis with huge computations
Aids like the abacus add mechanical memory to the computation process

** Switches

Flashlights, Telegraph, Boolean Algebra

On/Off languages, binary languages, binary algebra

Electronic switches are fast.

Translate computational problems into binary problems and give it to
the machine

** Structure

Programming a computer means working with the structural precision required by
computers. Computers consume data, apply instructions to transform
that data, and produce results in some form that we can use.

** Connections
* Let's talk about web creation and portfolio sites
** Choosing tools
** Motivating Web Creation
** Markup languages

- A lighter introduction to structured text
- HTML is a markup language
- Markup means using structure to tell a computer what things mean
- 
- HTML isn't the only option
- HTML 

** Symbols

#+BEGIN_NOTES
How do we tell
the computer which words are the content and which words are
instructions?
#+END_NOTES

** HTML Tags

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Compare indenting in a word process -- hit tab, see the word move --
to writing the word tab at the beginning of the line.  Instructions are given special characters that computers
can recognize. In HTML the symbols are called tags and use the "<" and
">" symbols.
#+END_NOTES

* Let's talk about email
** Locations: labels, tags, folders

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.

Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.

** Archive, Star, Delete

- Archive :: remove the inbox label
- Star :: add a star
- Label :: like star but with a custom name
- Delete :: remove all labels and add a "Trash" label

** Analyze

What kind of messages are you receiving?

Students were getting ten messages per day alerting them to various
activity on the platforms we set up for them: digital classroom,
communication blasts, attendance

** Process

Inbox -> Starred -> Archive
g i s e

Inbox -> Trash
#

Inbox -> Reply
r

** Stars and flags

- Starred is the activity section
- Multiple stars can represent different kinds of action
- 

** Filters

Inbox is a filter. A filter catches some values and let's others
through. Inbox shows us messages that contain the metadata "Inbox". 

Starred or flagged is a filter for all messages containing a metadata
star or flag. 

** Rules
** Notifications

** Assessment:  cultivating success

* Day 2 :noexport_reveal:
* Computing in the news
** Resources

* Let's talk about algebra
** Equations

Computer science can help us use precision in mathematics.

What is an equation?

Have you ever refered to an equation as
containing the answer?

** Functions

Repeatable computational abstractions
The target of elementary and middle school mathematics is modeling and
reasoning and expressions and equations standards are functions.

Equations are a catch all phrase in mathematics education that often
includes what we mean by functions in algebra.

Notice what changes, collect and plot data, predict/interpolate values

** Examples

A right circular cone has a height of 11 centimeters and a diameter of
7 centimeters. What is the approximate volume, in cubic centimeters,
of the cone?

- What skill is being assessed?
- What is given (context)?
- 

** Imagine data entities

Data entities are elements of our world that we might want to track as data.

Students in a school are often represented as a data point with a
number of dimensions. Some of the dimensions (or attributes)
associated with a student are attendance, credits, biographicals.

*Brainstorm* data entities from your own life.

* Let's talk about filters and sorts
