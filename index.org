 In the Internet simulator activities we will present a problem And demonstrate setting it up but not solve it together We'll enter breakout rooms to continue working on the problem connecting to the people in our room through the simulator. We need to develop an agreement between ourselves. We are acting like computers in a network network so we are inserting ourselves into the communication of the machines.. Only by coming up with an agreement can we reliably get our messages across

** Motivating Web Creation

Google docs rule the academic lives of many students.

Preformatted docs are often used to scaffold learning products.

Freedom with structure offers ownership of digital creations.

** Integration Tips

- Offer web creation skills to other teachers as an alternate work
  product format.
- Work with students to create a home for all of their work products. 
- Simplify assignment submissions by having students create pages to
  on their site for different assignments to simplify submission and
  develop a portfolio.

*** HTML isn't the only option
**** Lightweight markup languages

- AsciiDoc, Markdown, Org-mode

**** Heavier markup languages

- Latex, HTML

** Symbols and Syntax

Computers need data to have structure.

Structures are repeated patterns in data that a computer can be told how to process. 

HTML is a language that uses a system of tags to describe the role of different posts of a document.

** HTML Tags

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Compare indenting in a word process -- hit tab, see the word move --
to writing the word tab at the beginning of the line.  Instructions are given special characters that computers
can recognize. In HTML the symbols are called tags and use the "<" and
">" symbols.

* Let's talk about email
** Locations: labels, tags, folders

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.

Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.

** Archive, Star, Delete

- Archive :: remove the inbox label
- Star :: add a star
- Label :: like star but with a custom name
- Delete :: remove all labels and add a "Trash" label

** Analyze

What kind of messages are you receiving?

Students were getting ten messages per day alerting them to various
activity on the platforms we set up for them: digital classroom,
communication blasts, attendance

** Process

Inbox -> Starred -> Archive
g i s e

Inbox -> Trash
#

Inbox -> Reply
r

** Stars and flags

- Starred is the activity section
- Multiple stars can represent different kinds of action
- 

** Filters

Inbox is a filter. A filter catches some values and let's others
through. Inbox shows us messages that contain the metadata "Inbox". 

Starred or flagged is a filter for all messages containing a metadata
star or flag.

The Problems with Elon Musk's Plan to Open-Source the Twitter Algorithm
MIT Technology Review
Chris Stokel-Walker
April 27, 2022

Elon Musk’s announced plans for the Twitter social network include open-sourcing its algorithms, which experts say would do little to boost transparency without access to their training data. Said Jennifer Cobbe of the U.K.'s University of Cambridge, "Most of the time when people talk about algorithmic accountability these days, we recognize that the algorithms themselves aren't necessarily what we want to see—what we really want is information about how they were developed." There also are concerns open-sourcing Twitter's algorithms would enable bad actors to identify vulnerabilities to exploit and could make it more difficult to defeat spam bots.

Method Makes Traffic Prediction Faster
Futurity.org
Matt Shipman
May 5, 2022

North Carolina State University (NC State) researchers modified an algorithm developed to help simplify complex computing tasks to better anticipate traffic patterns in a specific place and time. The algorithm segments a bigger traffic forecasting model into a series of smaller problems that can be solved simultaneously. The process shortens the forecasting model's run time, while more complex questions tend to lead to higher levels of improved efficiency. The tweaked algorithm also enhances run time by allowing the model to realize when it has reached a solution that is within 5%, or even 10%, of the optimal solution. NC State's Ali Hajbabaie said the modified algorithm uses much less computer memory, and runs orders of magnitude faster, than a benchmark algorithm.

Open-Source 'Package Analysis' Tool Finds Malicious npm, PyPI Packages
BleepingComputer
Ax Sharma
May 1, 2022

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)'s prototype Package Analysis tool caught more than 200 malicious npm and Python Package Index (PyPI) packages in its initial run. Released this week on software development platform GitHub, the tool is designed to identify and counter malware in open source registries. OpenSSF's Caleb Brown and David A. Wheeler said the tool was developed to help users "understand the behavior and capabilities of packages available on open-source repositories: what files do they access, what addresses do they connect to, and what commands do they run? The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously." Most of the malicious elements the tool identified in its initial run were dependency confusion and typosquatting exploits.

Algorithm That Screens for Child Neglect Raises Concerns
Associated Press
Sally Ho; Garance Burke
April 29, 2022

A review of an algorithm designed to screen for child neglect has raised worrying issues, including questions of reliability. Carnegie Mellon University researchers analyzed a tool used by Allegheny County, PA, which in its first years of use identified a disproportionate number of Black children for "mandatory neglect" probes compared to white children; social workers also disagreed with the algorithm's risk scores about one-third of the time. Critics say the algorithm gives data on poor people excessive influence in deciding families' fates, and they caution against local officials' increasing reliance on artificial intelligence. Advocates fear that if similar tools are adopted by other child welfare systems with little to no human intervention, they could compound racial disparities.

2 + 2 is an expression, it's value is 4
The answer is 4

2+2=4 is an expression that evaluated to true. 

Solution checking and whether a given value turns an expression to a true statement. 

** Functions

Repeatable computational abstractions. The target of elementary and middle school mathematics is modeling and reasoning and expressions and equations standards are functions.

Equations are a catch all phrase in mathematics education that often includes what we mean by functions in algebra.

Notice what changes, collect and plot data, predict/interpolate values

** Operators
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2022-05-09 Mon 15:19]
   :END:

Binary operators are given two arguments
+, ×, ÷, -

Unary operators are given one argument
$a^b$, $sqrt{2}

Functions express operations as name and some any number of arguments

When we use name such as
sum, difference, product, and quotient we are invoking the function. 

** A formula is a function
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2022-05-06 Fri 13:20]
   :END:

In math class we often refer to "formulas" like the formula for the volume of a cone. 

Students "plug" numbers into the formula. Formulas are functions! 

Plugging-in is applying a function forming an expression (or what excel calls a formula :/

A right circular cone has a height of 11 centimeters and a diameter of
7 centimeters. What is the approximate volume, in cubic centimeters,

** Objectives

Participants will be able to...
- name and describe the parts of given tables,
- and distinguish between types of data and data representations in a
  given table.

** Data

- often means information about the world around us represented in a structure that can be read by
  computer
- data can often be represented as a table
- a spreadsheet is a program for interacting with tabular data
- programming languages can also manipulate tabular data

** Data Rows and Columns

Tables are made up of data rows and columns

**** Data Rows :: values relating to an entity (nouns)

  - a person, thing, or event
  - represented horizontally across the table

**** Columns :: properties or atributes about the entity (adjectives)

  - shared by other entities
  - each column has a name that identifies the attribute
  - represented vertically down the table

** Tables

Data rows begin under the *header*, which contains the names of each column

*** Check for understanding

How many data rows does this table contain?

| column 1   | column 2   | column 3   | column 4   |
|------------+------------+------------+------------|
| data value | data value | data value | data value |
| data value | data value | data value | data value |

** Activity

- Draw a circle around a column
- Draw an line through a row
- Draw an x over a column header

| Name             | ID | Attendance |

| Maurice Steadman | 29 |         96 |
| Sameera Yeoman   | 75 |         75 |

** Imagine data entities

Data entities are elements of our world that we might want to track as data.

Students in a school are often represented as a data point with a
number of dimensions. Some of the dimensions (or attributes)
associated with a student are attendance, credits, biographicals.

*Brainstorm* data entities from your own life.

** Types of Tables

- Tables for Computers :: data collection tables
  - often many rows
  - not human readable
  - one row per event
- Tables for Humans :: created from computer tables for humans
  - summary (pivot) tables
  - one row per category

** Example computer table

Submitting attendance is an example of a table for computers
#+BEGIN_NOTES

** Categorical and Quantitative Data

- Categorical data :: describe attributes that represent categories to which the entity belongs
  - *cannot* be used for arthimetics
  - adding, subtracting, multipyling, and dividing don't make sense
- Quantitative data :: describe attributes that count or measure part of the entity
  - *can* be used to for arithmetics
  - adding, subtracting, etc. produce meaningful results
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The issue here is one of meaning. These are types of knowledge. These distinctions determine what
operations are available to summariz and tranform the data.
#+END_NOTES

** Categorical or Quantitative?

- Who is the oldest in a particular grade?  
- Which students need attendance outreach?
- How many students have below 65% attendance in the 9th grade?
- Which cohort of students has the highest average assessment scores?
- Which zip code has students with the lowest attendance?
- Which advisor has the most students in need of attendance outreach?
- What is the average number of student logins to the online gradebook?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
What type of data knowledge would you use to answer each question?
#+END_NOTES

** Subgroups

- Large amounts of data are more useful when broken up into different subgroups
- If I am a principal, I might want to see data relating to only certain classrooms.
- If I am a parent, I only want data about a particular student.

*** Breakout

- What are some examples of subgroups of your students?
- How are those students described in meetings?
- What data is used to identify these sub-groups?

** Activity Overview

*Filter Views* Filter views represent subgroups of data.
- On the next slide you will recieve a link to some data about students.
- Find "Filter Views" in the _Data_ menu
- You will see several saved views.
- Each filter view represents a subgroup of students
- You can edit, duplicate, and create your own filter views.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Filter views are not filters. They can be saved and shared and exist separately from the data you
are viewing.
#+END_NOTES

** Student Data

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_Xxc7IK2IviW4gNmCHT4AVPgLKwhMU4HrJF7Z-Z_pk/copy][Make a copy of student dataset]] The link about allows you to copy a one semester summary of student
data.

Find "Filter Views" in the _Data_ menu

Try these actions:
- Open a filter view for a saved subgroup
- Duplicate a filter view -> rename the copy
- Change a filter view by sorting a column -> verify that your change is saved
- Create a new filter view

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Show the range of the filter view and explain the next level tip of the blank second row.
Spreadsheets aren't really tables because the header is treated like another cell.
#+END_NOTES

** Pivot Tables

- Pivot tables are summaries of large tables
- By grouping data together we can make a new table where each row entity is a summary of some part
  of the larger table.

*** Create a pivot table

Find "Pivot Table" in the _Data_ menu

Choose a range to summarize (the default is the entire tab you are currently viewing"

You can create a new sheet or add multiple pivot tables to one sheet.

*** Choose Rows

Choose your columns to be some categorical data that represents a subgroup of the data.

*** Choose columns

For each row what attributes to want to investigate

*** Choose value

For each attribute how would you like to summarize it?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Common summaries are sum, count, and average 
Remember if you are counting non-numeric data you need
to use COUNTA.
What are common ways we summarize student grades or attendance?
#+END_NOTES

** Cell References

Each cell is named by the absolute reference using the column letters first found at the top and row numbers second found along the side.

=A1 means get me the value from column A, row 1
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The leading equal sign (=) means "Hey spreadsheet I'm about to give you a formula."
#+END_NOTES

** Functions and Expressions (Formulas)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
=function(values)
#+END_EXAMPLE

- An expression is when you apply a function to a value. The function does its job and gives back the result.
- Expressions are like a sentence with verbs and nouns.
  - Verbs in a expression are called *Functions*
  - Nouns in a expression are called *Values*

** Function Contracts (protocols)

A contract is an agreement with the function. If we follow the contract, the function will do work for us. We need to give the function what is expected in its contract in order for it to do its work.
Type ~=concatenate~
Click ~?~ to see the function contract
What does concatenate expect to be given?
What will concatenate give back if you follow the contract?

** Copy down formulas for an entire column

Most spreadsheet functions work on single values
One way to apply a function to a range of values, such as all of the values in a column of data, you
can copy down the formula by...
- CTRL+↓ or CTRL+↑ jumps to the top or bottom of a column
- Add SHIFT, CTRL+SHIFT+↓ to select all cells below
- Ctrl+D to copy down formula
- Formulas in spreadsheets are made to be copied down. Cell references will change unless you tell them not too.

** Import Data

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/3inawmtc919pcgu/2021FallSemesterJumpropeData.csv?dl=0][Student data csv download]] Download the file above or use a csv of your own student data
- Open or create a sheet.
- Find "Import" from the _File_ menu.
- Choose the csv file for your data.
- Select an import option.
- Choose replace current sheet in most cases.
- Choose detect seperator automatically in most cases.
- Click import.

** Named ranges

- Open a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
- Select the cells you want to name.
- Click Data and then Named ranges. A menu will open on the right.
- Tip: To quickly open this menu, in the range box on the top left, click the drop down menu Down arrow >  Manage named ranges.
- Type the range name you want.
- To change the range, click Spreadsheet Grid.
- Select a range in the spreadsheet or type the new range into the text box, then click Ok.
- Click Done.

** Named ranges example

Assume you have the names *first_column* and *second_column* in your named ranges.
~=arrayformula(concatenate(first_column, second_column)~

** Array BuilderNotation

Creating custom arrays
You can also create your own arrays in a formula in your spreadsheet by using brackets { }. The brackets allow you to group values, which can be a single number, string or boolean, or a rangeof values. 

** Horizontal and Vertical Stacking
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2022-05-05 Thu 12:33]
   :END:

Use the following punctuation to arrange values in an array:

- *Commas:* Separate columns with a comma to arrange data horizontally. For example, ={1, 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell to the right in a new column.
- *Semicolons:* Separate rows with a semicolon to arrange data vertically. For example, ={1; 2} would place the number 1 in the first cell and the number 2 in the cell below in a new row.

Try on your own.

Recall the distributive property

$a(b+c) = ab + ac$


Compare the results of

~=arrayformula(a:b&b:b)~
to
~=arrayformula(concatenate(a:a,b:b)~

** Filter and sort functions

=FILTER(data, boolean-mask-to-apply-over-that-data)

Formulas in filters expand like an array formula

** Match an index
** Concatenate text with map
