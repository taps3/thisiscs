Particpants will...
  - engage in hands-on learning through a variety of computing tools
    and  classroom activities adaptable for a range of ages,
  - form connections between CS ed curricula and core academic subjects,
  - and solve school-based problems with spreadsheet data engineering. 

** The Plan

*** Day 1
- Computing in the News
- The internet
- Portfolio Sites
- Email

*** Day 2
- Algebra

** Computing in the news

*** Connections
** Let's talk about the internet
*** Code.org internet simulator
*** Protocols and Abstraction Layers
*** Packets and redundancy
*** Security
*** Connections
** Let's talk about email
*** Locations: labels, tags, folders

Folders remind us of putting a piece of paper in a filing cabinet.

Files are an idea. Another idea is to put one or more label on each
item and to collect together items with the same label when we need
them.

In a labeling system items can exist in more than one location.
*** Archive, Star, Delete
- Archive :: remove the inbox label
- Star :: add a star
- Label :: like star but with a custom name
- Delete :: remove all labels and add a "Trash" label

*** Analyze
What kind of messages are you receiving?

Students were getting ten messages per day alerting them to various
activity on the platforms we set up for them: digital classroom,
communication blasts, attendance

*** Process
Inbox -> Starred -> Archive
g i s e

Inbox -> Trash
#

Inbox -> Reply
r
*** Stars and flags
- Starred is the activity section
- Multiple stars can represent different kinds of action
- 
*** Filters
Inbox is a filter. A filter catches some values and let's others
through. Inbox shows us messages that contain the metadata "Inbox". 

Starred or flagged is a filter for all messages containing a metadata
star or flag. 
*** Rules

*** Notifications

*** Connections
** Let's talk about computers
*** Computers
From person to machine
Navigation, star charting, understanding the cosmos
All data analysis with huge computations
Aids like the abacus add mechanical memory to the computation process

*** Switches
Flashlights, Telegraph, Boolean Algebra

On/Off languages, binary languages, binary algebra

Electronic switches are fast.

Translate computational problems into binary problems and give it to
the machine

*** Connections
** Let's talk about running a computer lab
*** Room layout
*** Monitoring and Circulation
*** Structure
*** Rapport
*** Software
*** Debugging
*** Seating Charts and Pair Programming
*** Work products: analog and digital
*** Assessment:  cultivating success

** Computing in the news
*** Resources

** Let's talk about Algebra
*** Equations
Computer science can help us use precision in mathematics.

What is an equation?

Have you ever refered to an equation as
containing the answer?
*** Functions
Repeatable computational abstractions
The target of elementary and middle school mathematics is modeling and
reasoning and expressions and equations standards are functions.

Equations are a catch all phrase in mathematics education that often
includes what we mean by functions in algebra.

Notice what changes, collect and plot data, predict/interpolate values
*** Examples 
A right circular cone has a height of 11 centimeters and a diameter of
7 centimeters. What is the approximate volume, in cubic centimeters,
of the cone?

- What skill is being assessed?
- What is given (context)?
- 
*** Imagine data entities
Data entities are elements of our world that we might want to track as data.

Students in a school are often represented as a data point with a
number of dimensions. Some of the dimensions (or attributes)
associated with a student are attendance, credits, biographicals.

*Brainstorm* data entities from your own life.

** Let's talk about spreadsheets
** Let's talk about data science
** Let's talk about filters and sorts
